#task1
This Python program checks whether a number entered by the user is even or odd using simple conditional logic.

## Features

- Takes user input (an integer)
- Checks if the number is divisible by 2
- Prints whether the number is even or odd

## Code Logic

- Uses the modulo operator `%`
- If `a % 2 == 0`, then the number is even
- Otherwise, the number is odd

- 
- #task2
- This Python program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop and prints the result.

##  Features

- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50
- Accumulates the sum using a variable
- Prints the final sum

## Code Logic

- Initialize a variable `a = 0` to store the total
- Use `for i in range(1, 51)` to loop through numbers 1 to 50
- Add each number to the variable `a`
